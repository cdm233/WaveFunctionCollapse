# WaveFunctionCollapse
This program procedurally generates images based on the tile method. Wave function collapse is derived from quantum mechanics. It follows a specific rule for the generation of the image.
There are two methods used nowadays. I will be using the tile method to generate images.
The tile method speficies that an image is consisted of many tiles and the all the tiles needs to be connected in a specific way.
Each time the location that has the lowest entropy will be selected and a random tile that fits all the requirements will be used.

# Tiles and Their Properties
All the tiles that will be used to generate the image are contained in the image folder.
Inside of the folder it has each image and their property, which means who they can be connected with other tiles.

# What this can be used
For game map generation, for 2D games. 
This program can be expanded to 3D for object mesh generation. This included texture generation and such.

# Some other people's work that looks good
